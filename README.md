A chatting and file sharing application I created to learn Ruby with sinatra

I created this project to have some experience of ruby, with sinatra in the summer of 2015.

## Features
  - Sinatra Modular Application
  - MVC _like_ structure ( actually there are no models at present. Form the beggining the work of models was distributed between helpers and controllers and I didn't get time to refactor the code)
  - Server side pushes
  - Using data-mapper ruby ORM
  - Uses SDLite db, but can be very easily shifted because of ORM.
  - A strapup file which integrates a lot of things.
  - Automatic detection of helpers
  - Multiple tracks for chatting (multiple chatrooms)
  - Adding of users by admin and also sending request to be added.
