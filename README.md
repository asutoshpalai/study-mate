# study-mate
A chatting and file sharing application that I created for learning Ruby with sinatra

I created this project to have some experience of ruby, with sinatra in the summer of 2015.

## Technical Features
  - Sinatra Modular Application
  - MVC _like_ structure ( actually there are no models present because from the beggining the work of models was distributed between helpers and controllers and I didn't get time to refactor the code)
  - Uses Server side pushes
  - Uses data-mapper (ORM)
  - Uses slim as template engine
  - Uses coffe-script
  - scss for css pre-processing
  - Uses SDLite db, but can be easily shifted to anyother DBMS.
  - A strapup file which integrates a lot of things.
  - Automatic detection of helpers
